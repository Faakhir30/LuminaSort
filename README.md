# LuminaSort - Sorting Visualization App

LuminaSort is a ReactJS application that provides visualizations of various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. With LuminaSort, users can generate random arrays of different sizes and observe the sorting process in real-time. The app allows users to adjust the sorting speed and provides an interactive and educational experience for understanding sorting algorithms.

## Features

- Sorting Visualizations: LuminaSort offers visual representations of different sorting algorithms, enabling users to see how each algorithm rearranges elements to achieve a sorted array.

- Sorting Algorithms: The app includes implementations of several sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Users can choose which algorithm to visualize and compare their performance.

- Random Array Generation: Users can generate random arrays of various sizes to test the sorting algorithms. This feature allows for experimenting with different array lengths and observing how the algorithms handle different input scenarios.

- Sorting Speed Control: LuminaSort provides a speed control feature, allowing users to adjust the sorting speed to their preference. This functionality enables users to visualize the sorting process at a pace that suits their learning needs.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: LuminaSort is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS provides a modular and efficient approach to developing interactive web applications.

- Sorting Algorithms: The sorting algorithms implemented in LuminaSort are coded in JavaScript and integrated into the ReactJS application.

- Styling: The app is styled using CSS, providing an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface.
